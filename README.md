# Video Converter Web App

A simple, browser-based video converter built with React and FFMPEG.wasm. Convert your videos directly in the browser without uploading them to any server.

## Features

- üé• Browser-based video conversion
- üîí Privacy-focused (no server uploads)
- ‚ö° Fast, client-side processing
- üì± Responsive design
- üéõÔ∏è Advanced conversion settings:
  - Video codec selection (H.264/H.265)
  - Audio codec options (AAC/MP3)
  - Customizable bitrates
  - Frame rate control
  - Resolution scaling with aspect ratio preservation

## Technology Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- FFMPEG.wasm
- Vite

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/addyosmani/video-compress.git
cd video-compress
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

1. Click the upload area or drag and drop a video file
2. Adjust conversion settings (optional):
   - Select video and audio codecs
   - Set bitrates
   - Choose frame rate
   - Adjust resolution
3. Click "Convert to MP4" to start the conversion
4. Wait for the conversion to complete
5. The converted video will automatically download

## Technical Notes

- The app uses Web Assembly through FFMPEG.wasm for video processing
- Cross-Origin Isolation is required for SharedArrayBuffer support
- Resolution scaling maintains aspect ratio using the formula: `scale='min(target_width,iw)':'-2'`
- Video dimensions are automatically adjusted to be divisible by 2 for codec compatibility
